## Description
This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The application uses a Express backend server to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The developer used the GET, POST, and DELETE methods to accomplish the basic functionality. The user will be able to take persistent notes by accessing the application on Heroku.
